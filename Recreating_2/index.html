      <p class="review">“It was a brave decision by Navin to entrust the telling of such a powerful story to a six-year-old but she pulls it off to perfection. This is the authentic voice of an honest, bright, intelligent, and observant child. It struck me that any of us would be proud to have Zach as their son.”</p>

        <p>“Only Child triumphs. Zach, at only 6 years old, understands more about the human heart than the broken adults around him. His hope and optimism will have every reader cheering him on, and believing in happy endings even in the face of such tragedy.”</p> <!--Class of grey-->

        <h1>About Rhiannon Navin</h1><!--Float left-->
        <p>I grew up in Bremen, Germany, in a family of book-crazy women. My career in advertising brought me to New York City in my early twenties. After working for several large ad agencies in the city, I left the rat race to be home with my three spirited (read: loud and strong-willed) children. Being a full-time mom is the best job in the world. It's also the hardest and not always the most fulfilling. Then a magical thing happened: I discovered my love for writing. And over the course of a couple of life-changing years, I wrote my first novel, <span>Only Child.</span></p>

       <p>I can't believe I get to share it with you now! Only Child has been published by Knopf here in the U.S. and by Mantle in the U.K.. It will also be published in many <span>countries</span> around the world and translated into sixteen other languages. I can't wait for you to read it.</p>

        <p>I made this website for you, dear reader. I invite you to become <span>involved.</span></p>

        <p>Would you like to invite me to talk about Only Child at your next book club or library event? I'm available for events in the NYC area or via Skype or FaceTime. <span>Contact me here.</span></p>

        <p>Please check out my <span>upcoming events</span>, I would love to see you there.</p>
